Q.1  What is a variable in Python Programming Language and
explain the rules to declare a variable.

Solution:- 
         A variable is a named location in memory that is used to store data. 
It acts as a container for storing values that can be accessed and manipulated in code.

Rules to declare the variables:
	1. Variable name must start with character or underscore (_).
	2. Variable cna't start with numbers.
	3. Variable name can use alpha-numeric values.
	4. Variable must not contain python keywords.
	5. Variable names are case-sensitive.
	6. Variable name cannot use spaces, use underscore (_).

Q2.  Write a Python Program to generate and prints a list of numbers
from 1 and 10.

Solution:-
       - Python code:
	numbers = []

	for i in range(1, 11):
    		numbers.append(i) #appending the list with elements

	for number in numbers:
   		print(number) # Print the list of numbers

	
	- Code Sumary:
 
1. We start by creating an empty list called numbers to store the generated numbers.

2. We use a for loop with the range() function. The range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 to 10. The loop variable i takes on each value from 1 to 10 in each iteration.

3. Inside the loop, we use the append() method to add each number i to the numbers list. This appends the current value of i to the end of the list.

4. Once the loop completes, we have a list numbers containing the numbers from 1 to 10.

5. Finally, we use another for loop to iterate over each element in the numbers list. The loop variable number takes on each value from the list in each iteration.

6. Inside this loop, we use the print() function to output each number on a separate line.

Q3. Write a Python Program to sum all the numbers in a list.

Solution:-
       - Python code:
	num = [22, 5, 7, 2, 22]

	sum_of_num = 0

	for x in num:
   	 sum_of_num += x

	# Print the sum of the numbers
	print("Sum of numbers:", sum_of_num)
	
	- Code Sumary:

1. We start by creating a list of numbers called numbers. In this example, it contains [10, 5, 7, 2, 15], but you can modify it with your own numbers.

2. We initialize a variable called sum_of_numbers to 0. This variable will store the sum of all the numbers in the list.

3. We use a for loop to iterate over each element in the numbers list. In each iteration, the loop variable number takes on the value of the current number.

4. Inside the loop, we add the current number number to the sum_of_numbers variable using the += operator. This accumulates the sum as we iterate through the list.

5. Once the loop completes, the sum_of_numbers variable will hold the sum of all the numbers in the list.

6. Finally, we use the print() function to output the sum of the numbers.

Q4.  Write a Python Program to multiply all the numbers in a list.

Solution:-
       - Python code:
	numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

	# Initialize a variable to store the result
	result = 1

	# Iterate over each number in the list
	for number in numbers:
    		# Multiply the current number with the result
    		result *= number

# Print the final result
print("Multiplication result:", result)


	- Code Sumary:

1. We start by creating a list of numbers called numbers. In this example, it contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], but you can modify it with your own numbers.

2. We initialize a variable called result to 1. This variable will store the final result of multiplying all the numbers in the list.

3. We use a for loop to iterate over each element in the numbers list. In each iteration, the loop variable number takes on the value of the current number.

4. Inside the loop, we multiply the current number number with the result variable using the *= operator. This accumulates the multiplication as we iterate through the list.

5. Once the loop completes, the result variable will hold the multiplication of all the numbers in the list.

6. Finally, we use the print() function to output the final result of the multiplication.
